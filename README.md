# Diecast Collector Nodejs API

**diecast-collector-nodejs-api** Is a REST API developed with (guess what) **Node JS**. It's goal is to help me keep track of my miniature car collection (Hot Wheels, Maisto, California Collectibles, etc) and to provide a general use case for studying new technologies.
Also check out the [Web App](https://github.com/lbbedendo/diecast-collector-app) built with React. I've also developed a version of this API with [Micronaut Framework](https://micronaut.io/) (You can check the repository [here](https://github.com/lbbedendo/diecast-collector-api)).
